OpenDots is an open-source, integrated IoT data visualization and insight platform that helps users turn raw sensor data into meaningful, real-time visuals and AI-powered insights. It is designed to be hardware-agnostic, data-first, and easy to extend for contributors.

## Overview

OpenDots allows users to collect, visualize, and analyze live data from multiple IoT sources in one unified platform. Instead of building separate systems for data ingestion, dashboards, and analysis, OpenDots combines everything into a single workflow.

Users can create highly customizable dashboards, publish sharable project sites, monitor live data streams, and interact with their data using AI-based insights.

## Key Features

- Highly customizable dashboards with flexible layouts and visualizations  
- Live data logs and real-time visualizations using WebSockets  
- Sharable public project websites for collaboration and showcase  
- Support for Arduino-based systems and popular IoT platforms  
- Integration with ThingSpeak, Adafruit IO, Blynk, and Grafana  
- Support for live camera feeds and video streams  
- Chat-based AI insights for trends, summaries, and anomaly detection
